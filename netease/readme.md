# NetEase

- NetEase is a deep user of the Tekton project and we use it on almost all of our cloud native architectures.
- We use it in a number of scenarios, including continuous delivery, GitOps, and Serverless, that have been implemented and used in our business.
- We use a lot of  function of Tekton and also implement some supporting components, such as storage-based resource archiving server.
- We are impressed by Tekton's lightness and ease of use, and we are committed to simplifying the deployment and use of the pipeline by this lightweight product, and make it transparent to the end user.
